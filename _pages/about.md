I am a lecturer (equivalent to AP in mainland China) in [Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://www.swufe.edu.cn/) (Sichuan Province, China). I persued my PhD at [School of Econimics, Peking University](https://econ.pku.edu.cn/) during 2018-2023. My research interest lies in optimal taxation theory, local public finance and fiscal federalism.
