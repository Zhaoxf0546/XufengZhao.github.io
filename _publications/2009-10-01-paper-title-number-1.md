We develop a principal-agent model to characterize optimal place-based intergovernmental transfer policies, incorporating both asymmetric information and a general form of externalities. The optimal nonlinear transfer scheme addresses the dual objectives of equity and efficiency. Using county-level fiscal data from China, we conduct numerical simulations to explore potential transfer reforms. Our results show that the optimal marginal transfer is lower than the current level, and the presence of externalities reverses its sign. Transitioning from the existing transfer system to the optimal one leads to welfare gains equivalent to an increase in per capita consumption ranging from 4.02% to 4.25%.
