This paper is still unfinished. 
Highlights: 
1. Disentangling the scale and type effects which contribute to heterogeneous capital returns using an endogenous assignment model.

2. Extending the variation approach to derive the optimal Mirrleesian capital tax under the environment with endogenous capital returns and multidimensional heterogeneities.

3. Deriving the optimal capital tax formula in the ABC plus D form, incorporating both type and scale effects.
